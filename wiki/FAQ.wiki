Q: I need my websites encoded in ISO-8859-1. Where to adjust it?

A: Just modify encoding of your template file. MP3Toolbox detects encoding and uses it for output.

Q: ID3 tags of some files couldn't be read. They are listed on error tab. iTunes shows their tag content correctly. Why?

A: I use a 3rd party library to read tags. Please convert your tags to at least ID3v2 and you are fine.

Q: Why does it takes a long time to scan my huge collection of music? My collection (> 10.000 songs) resides on my NAS and is mounted as a share.

A: Get a cup of coffee and be patient ;-) Make sure your network connection is fast. mp3toolbox is a lightweight tool without database and file change monitoring.
